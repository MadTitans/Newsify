# Newsify
Alexa Skill Newsify to announce top 5  news from a certain category or a keyword. Gives news from around the globe or a particular country.

**Introduction:**

When we talk or think about Alexa, we talk about voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, providing weather, traffic, and other real-time information, controlling several smart devices used in a home automation system. With Alexa, we can build natural voice experiences that offer a more intuitive way to interact with the technology they we use every day. We are excited to be able to extend the Alexa capabilities by proposing our "skills".

**Skill Features:** 

-  Giving Top 5 news from a user's chosen category.
-  Giving top 5 news globally or from a country or state the user wants.
-  Users can listen to a brief description of a particular news (recited in the top 5 news).
-  Newsify returns corresponding title, description, links and media for the news on Alexa App smart mobile devices.

**Invoking The Skill:** 
To invoke Newsify, you need to say :
>Alexa, open Newsify.

And then, you can ask Newsify to recite latest Top 5 news belonging to a particular keyword/category.
-  Latest News In "Technology".
-  Latest News In "Art".
-  Latest "Technology" News.
-  Latest "Art" News.
  
The news recited is global, so if you want to know latest news from a particular country, then just speak :
- Top 5 news in "India".
- What happened in "India".

If you want Newsify to give a brief detail about a particular news (recited in the top 5 news), you need to tell the "position" of the news. For Example :
-  Give me more information about "second" news.
-  Tell me more about "second" news.

To make Newsify give a brief detail about a news, you **must** ask top 5 news from either of the top 5 news types mentioned above.

**Skill Future Scope:** 

-  Giving personalized news to the Alexa Customers and presenting latest blogs from medium.com for the Alexa Customers. 
-  People can create their profiles and set the category of news and blogs they would like to know about. Alexa will recite the latest blog and news from that category. 
-  Creating a profile is a one-time step and then the user can provide their name and Alexa will recite the news and blog from the category that the user opted for. 
-  Creating multiple profiles for multiple users. This will provide more personalized experience even if there is only 1 Alexa device, but multiple users.

**Skill Category:** News, Entertainment, Social, Education

Target Audience: Any user who wishes to get the personalized news and blogs at any given time of day. There is no such age group restriction or specific age target.

**Brief Description of the Idea:**

In todayâ€™s life, everyone is busy and everyone is living a hectic life. And we often miss daily news updates or special blogs from the bloggers we follow. Every user is different and they may want to know the news and blogs related to some specific topics or category only based on their personal interest, but because of the enervation, people skips the news or the blog which was once a habit. Currently there is no such skill available for Alexa that provides a personalized news or blog search experience. This skill we want to develop will do so. Alexa users can ask Alexa anytime to recite the most recent news from various category.
